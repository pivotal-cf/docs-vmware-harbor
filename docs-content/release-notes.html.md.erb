### <a id="v2.3.1_new"></a> New Features

The Harbor v2.3.1 release includes the following new features:

- Declarative Configuration: Enhanced the current configuration by adding environment variables to overwrite the Harbor configuration including auth, backing store, system permissions and more. This enables full audit capabilities and prevents configuration drift. This addresses [#8076](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/8076).
- IPv6：Support running Harbor in Kubernetes with harbor-helm on IPv6-only infrastructure. (Tested on Kubernetes version 1.21.0 with Calico version 3.18.1.)
- Several components are upgraded, including:
  - Upgrade all Harbor base images from Photon 2.0 to 4.0.
  - Postgresql upgrade to v13.3.
  - Redis upgrade to v6.0.13.
  - Trivy upgrade to v0.17.2
  - Golang upgrade to v1.15.12. 
  - Docker upgrade to v20.10.7
- Additional new features:
  - Performance enhancement for concurrent requests.
  - Observability Metrics Improvement: Support Jobservice metrics.
  - Swagger API Improvement: The APIs of project scanners and webhooks support both project id and name in their path.
  - Replication enhancement to support destination namespace flattening.
  - Move the legacy APIs to the new programming model.

### <a id="v2.3.1_upgrade"></a> Upgrade Considerations

- You must back up your data before upgrading to v2.3.1 because, dring upgrade, Harbor will remove the old Postgres data and migrate it to a new destination compatible with a new version of Postgres. 

### <a id="v2.3.1_deprecations"></a> Feature Deprecations

- The ChartMuseum is scheduled to be deprecated in a future v2.4.0 release. The ChartMuseum is scheduled to be deprecated in a future v2.4.0 release. Helm charts can be managed in Harbor through the OCI image registry alongside your container images.

### <a id="v2.3.1_breaking"></a> Breaking Changes

- The API to GET artifact under public projects such as GET /v2/$public_project/$repo/manifests/$tag, will receive a 401 if the request does not carry "Authorization" header. For more details, see 
[#14711](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/14711) and [#14768](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/pull/14768)

### <a id="v2.3.1_fixed"></a> Resolved Issues

Listed below are key issues fixed in the Harbor tile v2.3.1. Refer to the full list of [closed issues in Harbor v2.3.0](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Atarget%2F2.3.0+is%3Aclosed) at the Harbor OSS site.

- Fixed the notary key not found issue after migration. To Fix [#14932](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/14932), v2.3.1 downgrades the Go version of Notary to v1.14. However, the fixing will cause another break change: If a key is created when signing the image in v2.2.0 ~ v2.2.2, a similar key decoding issue like #14932 will happen if you upgrade from v2.2.0 ~ v2.2.2 to v2.3.1. The workaround(https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/wiki/Harbor-FAQs#notary-key-not-found) can handle it.
- Added retry for garbage collection when to remove blob and manifest.
- Fixed OIDC access token issue.

- Notary key not found after migration. To Fix [#14932](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/14932), v2.2.3 downgrades the Go version of Notary to v1.14. However, doing so can cause another breaking change: If a key is created when signing the image in v2.2.0, v2.2.1, or v2.2.2, a similar key decoding issue like #14932 can occur when you upgrade from v2.2.0, v2.2.1, or v2.2.2 to v2.2.3. In this case, refer to the [workaround](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/wiki/Harbor-FAQs#notary-key-not-found) to address this issue.
- Fix migration issue from v1.10
- Proxy cache enhancement for upstream registry is not working

### <a id="v2.2.1_new"></a> New Features

The Harbor v2.2.1 release includes the following new features:

- System-level Robot Account
  - Introduce system-level robot accounts to enable them to access multiple projects.
  - Support for Aqua CSP Scanner
  - Selective API access for robot accounts

### <a id="v2.2.1_upgrade"></a> Upgrade Considerations

- Clair deprecated: The built-in Clair image scanner is deprecated in favor of Trivy. If you have enabled the Clair scanner, see [breaking changes](#v2.2.1_breaking) before upgrading.
- Certificate Impact: Since Harbor is compiled by Golang v1.15.6, the certificates may need to be updated. Go v1.15.0 introduced changes to SSL/TLS connection validation which requires certificates to include a SAN. This field was not included in older certificates are generated by Harbor prepare script. For more information, see Go GitHub issue [golang/go#39568](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/39568).

### <a id="v2.2.1_deprecations"></a> Feature Deprecations

- Deprecate built-in Clair. Users still have the option to install Clair in out-of-tree fashion by pairing with Harbor through its interrogation services framework.
- The ChartMuseum is scheduled to be deprecated in a future v2.4.0 release.

### <a id="v2.2.1_breaking"></a> Breaking Changes

- The built-in Clair container image scanner is deprecated in favor of Trivy. If you have enabled Clair, do one of the following before ugprading to Harbor tile v2.2.1:
    - In the Harbor tile, select the Trivy scanner as the default in "Interrogation Service" or
    - Install the Clair scanner outside the Harbor tile VM and configure the Clair scanner in "Interrogation Service" as the default scanner. Refer to the Clair documentation. 
- API: The /systeminfo API now displays less information when the request is triggered by an unauthenticated user. For details please refer to the following issue comment: #9149 (comment)
- Scan Report: After upgrading to v2.2, all scan reports in the previous version have been deleted due to changes in the vulnerability database scheme. Please rescan the artifacts to obtain the reports.

**Project Quotas**

By using quota management, system administrators can set constraints that limit the number of artifacts or the amount of storage resources that a project can use. This helps system administrators to better manage and allocate resources across all projects. [Read more](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/master/docs/user_guide.md#set-project-quotas)

**Tag Retention**

A repository can rapidly accumulate a large number of image tags, many of which might not be required after a given time or once they have been superseded by a subsequent image build. These excess tags can obviously consume large quantities of storage capacity. As a system administrator, you can define rules that govern how many tags of a given repository to retain, or for how long to retain certain tags. [Read more](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/master/docs/user_guide.md#tag-retention-rules)

**Webhooks**

Webhooks allow for the integration of Harbor with other tools to streamline continuous integration and development processes.  Currently, webhooks can be configured for actions including container image push, container image pull, container image delete, helm chart push, helm chart pull, helm chart delete, image scanning completed, CVE discovered [Read more](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/master/docs/user_guide.md#webhook-notifications)

**CVE Whitelists**

As a system administrator, you can create exception policies of certain whitelisted CVEs to ignore during vulnerability policy checking. [Read more](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/master/docs/user_guide.md#configure-cve-whitelists)

## <a id='v1.7.1'></a> v1.7.1

**Release Date:** January 16, 2019

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: We recommend that you skip the Harbor v1.7.1 release and install or upgrade to <a href="release-notes.html#v1.7.2">Harbor v1.7.2</a>.</p>

VMware Harbor Registry v1.7.1 is a general availability release with several new features and fixes.

### New Features

* Support for [Harbor Registry Release-1.7.0](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/wiki/Release-1.7.0).
* Bump stemcell version to ubuntu-xenial 170.14.

### Fixed Issues

* You can now change the Harbor `admin` password using the Harbor web interface. You must enter the new password in the **Admin Password to run smoke test** field of the **Credentials** pane in the Harbor tile before reinstalling or upgrading the Harbor tile.
* The parameter `registry` is added by default and does not have to be added manually to the `no_proxy` field for Clair proxy configuration.

### Known Issues

When upgrading from Harbor v1.6.0 to v1.7.1, the upgrade procedure may fail with the following error message: `1 of 3 pre-start scripts failed. Failed Jobs: harbor.` The workaround is to log in to the Harbor VM with BOSH and check the Docker images. If there are any Docker images found for `vmware/harbor-log`, remove the images before migration. After removing the images, click **Apply Changes** in Ops Manager and retry the upgrade. This issue is addressed in Harbor v1.7.2. 

For guidance on logging in to the Harbor VM using BOSH, see [Using BOSH Diagnostic Commands in TKGI](https://docs.pivotal.io/tkgi/manage-deployments-bosh.html).

See the following example commands to check for Docker images in `vmare/harbor-log`:
    
```
alias docker='/var/vcap/packages/docker/bin/docker -H unix:///var/vcap/sys/run/docker/dockerd.sock'
docker images | grep vmware/harbor-log
```

See the following example command to remove any Docker images found for `vmware/harbor-log`:

```    
docker rmi IMAGES-ID-OF-VMWARE/HARBOR-LOG
```
